# CNN-on-CIFAR
CIFAR-10 by DenseNet Implementation Cifar-10 is a popular dataset available at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html We plan to solve this problem by the use of Densenet Architecture. An awesome way of solving this problem with help of Resnet is available at keras website https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_resnet/Â¶
